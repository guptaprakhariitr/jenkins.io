If you see a little black clock icon in the build queue as shown below,
it is an indication that your job is sitting in the queue unnecessarily.

The tool tip of the job name link next to the clock icon should tell you
exactly why it is not building, but the common symptoms are as follows:

1.  **Slaves are offline**: your build needs to run on a particular
    slave, but the slave is offline. Go to
    <http://server/hudson/computer/SLAVENAME> to figure out why, and
    bring it back online. Or better yet, use labels and do not tie
    builds to specific slaves, so that a single offline slave will not
    prevent your builds from starving.
2.  **Waiting for an available executor on a slave**: your build needs
    to run on a particular slave, but the slave is already fully busy
    building other things, and your build is waiting for "too long"
    compared to the time it takes to execute it â€” in other words, it
    does not make sense to wait for 5 minutes when the build itself
    finishes in 2 minutes. Use labels so that builds can run on any
    machine that satisfies the system requirements, and in this way you
    can add more slaves to improve the turn-around time.
3.  **Waiting for an available executor on a label**: all the slaves
    that have the given label are fully busy doing other things. It is
    time to add more slaves.
